# Week11 mini rust project -- Room Adventure Game
This project implements a simple command-line text adventure game:

The player starts in a dark room, and can only move to the north. They eventually come across a chest that they can open to find a key. Using the key, they can return to the first room and "unlock" a door to win the game.

Type `make run` to start the game!

You will see the game instruction:
```
Welcome to the adventure!
You are in a dark room.
You see a door to the north.
